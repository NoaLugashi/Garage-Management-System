Garage Management System

Project Overview

This project is a C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application designed to manage a garage that services different types of vehicles. The system allows tracking vehicles, managing their owners, and performing various maintenance actions.

Features

Manage multiple vehicle types: Motorcycles, Cars, and Trucks (both fuel-based and electric)

Track vehicle details including owner information, fuel levels, battery status, and tire pressure

Perform maintenance actions:

Refuel vehicles (with proper fuel type validation)

Recharge electric vehicles (within capacity limits)

Inflate tires to the correct pressure

Vehicle status management (In Repair, Repaired, Paid)

Console-based user interface

Structured in two layers:

GarageLogic (DLL) - Implements the logic layer, including object models and business rules

ConsoleUI (EXE) - Provides an interactive text-based interface
